## PyLadies Intermediate Python class, 20141017

1. Review of loops: `for`, `while`. 

  2. Sample `for`-loop.

        ```python
lst = []
for i in range(10):
    lst.append(i)
print(lst)
        ```

  2. Replacing a loop with a comprehension: 

    3. list-comprehensions

        ```python
lst = [i for i in range(10)]
        ```

    3. set-comprehensions

        ```python
qqq
        ```

    3. dict-comprehensions

        ```python
qqq
        ```


  2. Nesting

    3. nested loops

        ```python
qqq
        ```

    3. nested comprehensions

        ```python
qqq
        ```


  2. Filtering

    3. `if`-blocks and `continue` within a loop

        ```python
qqq
        ```

    3. filtering within a comprehension

        ```python
qqq
        ```


1. Timing

  2. Using `timeit` (`%timeit` in Ipython) to find the average time to run a code block.

        ```python
qqq
        ```

  2. Timing differences between comprehensions and `for`-loops.

        ```python
qqq
        ```


1. Generators and other forms of lazy evaluation

  2.

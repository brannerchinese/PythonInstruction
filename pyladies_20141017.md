## PyLadies Intermediate Python class, 20141017

1. Review of loops: `for`, `while`. 

  2. Sample `for`-loop.

        ```python
        In [1]: lst = []
        
        In [2]: for i in range(10):
           ...:     lst.append(i)
           ...:     
        
        In [3]: print(lst)
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        ```

  2. Replacing a loop with a comprehension: 

    3. list-comprehensions. Syntax:

        ```python
        In [4]: lst = [i for i in range(10)]
        
        In [5]: print(lst)
        Out[5]: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
        ```

    3. set-comprehensions

        ```python
        In [6]: s = {i for i in range(10)}
        
        In [7]: s
        Out[7]: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
        ```

    3. dict-comprehensions

        ```python
        In [11]: d = {i: i ** 2 for i in range(10)}
        
        In [12]: print(d)
        {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}
        ```

      Further: use `zip(list1, list2)` to draw keys and values from different lists:

        ```python
        In [13]: d2 = {i: j for i,j in zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3])}
        
        In [14]: print(d2)
        {'c': 3, 'a': 1, 'b': 2}
        ```

  2. Nesting

    3. nested loops

        ```python
qqq
        ```

    3. nested comprehensions

        ```python
qqq
        ```


  2. Filtering

    3. `if`-blocks and `continue` within a loop

        ```python
qqq
        ```

    3. filtering within a comprehension

        ```python
qqq
        ```


1. Timing

  2. Using `timeit` (`%timeit` in Ipython) to find the average time to run a code block.

        ```python
qqq
        ```

  2. Timing differences between comprehensions and `for`-loops.

        ```python
qqq
        ```


1. Generators and other forms of lazy evaluation
